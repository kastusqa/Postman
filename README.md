# Postman
### REST and SOAP API testing via Postman

- I tested  methods that are provided for https://petstore.swagger.io/ in Postman and created the corresponding collections:
 [Postamn collection](https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=25316813-dd9d157c-0680-4714-8b3f-3d7d0928ba62&entityType=collection) for the petstore: REST
- Using the following [WSDL](http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL), I created a working collection in Postman that can be used to determine: a country's currency, full country information, and country specific language information:
- [Postamn collection](https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=25316813-2502838a-a3c2-468d-907e-d368158e3b60&entityType=collection): SOAP
